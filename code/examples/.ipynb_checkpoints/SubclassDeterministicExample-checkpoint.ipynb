    "\n",

    "    2. how we will pick among the selection of spouses, and \n",
    "    3. where newlyweds live\n",

    "We define an eligible partner as any single, eligible (`unmarried`), non-sibling in the same community using `get_eligible_not_sibling_same_community`. We pick a spouse at random from the selection (`pick_spouse_random`) and then attempt to move the new couple in with the husband's family if there is space; otherwise they move to a new house (`locality_patrilocality`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `MobilityRule`: Adult children leave a household with their nuclear family if it gets overcrowded\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MobilityRule` we will create will check whether an adult is living in an overcrowded house they don't own, and then move them with their spouse and children to a new house. There exists a default function to check whether a household is overcrowded (`check_household_overcrowded`), but we need to create a new function that combines this with the age check and the ownership check. We will call this function `check_household_nonowner_adult_man_overcrowded` to keep the nomenclature consistent. We then use the existing `who_leaves_house_family` to identify their family and `destination_random_house_same_village` to find a new house to move them to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `InheritanceRule`: Let sons and then brothers' sons inherit houses, but only own one\n",
    "\n",
    "The `InheritanceRule` will be to check the male line of a family, starting with male children and followed by brothers' sons. We implement this by using the `find_heirs_multiple_constructor`, which combines multiple `find_heirs` functions into a single ordered list. We call this new function `find_heirs_sons_then_brothers_sons` and use it to defined the heirs of a person with a house to be inherited (`has_property_houses`). We then limit all heirs to lack property before inheritance (`limit_heirs_not_owners`), and say that the first heir in the list (who is therefore likely the oldest son or oldest brother's older son without a house) will be the one to inherit (`distribute_property_to_first_heir_and_move_household`). If inheritance fails, the house defaults to no owner, and once all family members leave or die it will default to no ownership (`failed_inheritance_no_owner`). \n",
    "\n",
    "### `BirthRule`: Use the fertility schedule without infanticide or maternal death\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the AgeTable for fertiltiy above, the `BirthRule` just passes this as the fertility for a married woman, with fertility for an unmarried woman defined as a NullAgeTable (always 0). The sex ratio is 50-50, and neither infanticide nor maternal death during childbirth are chosen as options."
